                I am a Mechanical Engineering student at the Colorado School of Mines with a minor in Robotics and 
                Intelligent Systems, currently pursuing a Master’s degree in Robotics Engineering. My work focuses on 
                distributed robotics and resilient multi-agent systems. At the MPALA Lab, I develop and test aerial swarm
                platforms using Crazyflie drones, OptiTrack motion capture, and ROS 2 to study consensus and resilient 
                control algorithms under real-world conditions.

                <h2>Background & Interests</h2>
                    <p class="content-summary">
                    My academic interests are centered around multi-agent robotic systems, though I’m generally curious 
                    about most areas of engineering. I spent all of high school as the lead programmer for my school’s 
                    robotics team, so when it came time to choose a major, computer science felt like the obvious path.
                    At the same time, I’ve always enjoyed working with my hands and understanding how things are built. 
                    I didn’t want my work to live entirely behind a screen. Choosing mechanical engineering gave me the 
                    chance to develop the intuition and practical background needed to design robotic systems, not just
                    program them. I’ve especially enjoyed SolidWorks modeling and finite element analysis because they let 
                    me turn abstract ideas into physical designs and test assumptions before anything is built.
